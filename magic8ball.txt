Realistically no, but for the sake of keeping you entertained, why not?
Absolutely 100% yes.
Being abducted by aliens is more likely.
Hmm... maybe? That's a bit of a weird question to ask to begin with isn't it?
Nope. Just nope. Don't even ask me that again.
Try asking one more time.
Yeah, I could see that being the case.
Definitely possible, but I'd wait and see what happens.
Nah, it's a no from me.
Yes yes yes oh my fucking ***god*** yes.
I suppose so, under the right circumstances.
That's a good question... 
If you have to ask, you already know the answer. 
Sorry, the answer is a definite no. Anything else you care to ask?
I've taken the liberty of formatting my answer in an easy to read haiku:<br>no no no no no<br>never going to be a thing<br>shit's impossible
This is bullshit - you're oversimplifying a complex situation to the point of no longer adding anything useful to the discussion.
Just go talk to them. Tell them what you just told us.
Honestly you can't even answer that question without making so many compromises that the answer given is no longer a valid response to begin with.
I can't be fucked to figure that one out, but I do like your username. Care to give !sub or !dom a try next time you get a minute? ;)
Didn't someone ask this like 10 minutes ago?
